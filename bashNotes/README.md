# Bash Notes for Professionals - Practice Folder

This folder is dedicated to my learning and practice of **Bash scripting**, following the book **"Bash Notes for Professionals"**.

Here, I will:

- Experiment with example scripts from the book.
- Take notes on important Bash concepts and syntax.
- Practice real-world scripting tasks to sharpen my shell scripting skills.

Feel free to browse the scripts and notes. This is a work-in-progress learning space.
